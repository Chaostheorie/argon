# Argon

argon is a client for [schulerzbistum.de](https://www.schulerzbistum.de) and improves the user experience by simplifying the user interface while maintaining all functionality. This client only maintains pupil accessible functions due to a lack of access of admin functions for development purposes. If you want a version accessing your own webweaver instance take a look at the development notes or [contact me](https://sinclair.gq/pages/contact.html).

## Development notes

The backend logic (data processing etc.) is in the `main.ts` (typescript) while all of the page specific logic (interaction related) (javascript) is in the `src/specific/{name}.js` files.

To get documentation on your available endpoints and services for the jsonrpc API by webweaver visit `https://HOST/wws/559185.php` (e.g. `https://www.schulerzbistum.de/wws/559185.php`).

The interface is for several reasons (mainly the actual userspace) written in German. This will be changed with mutltilang (eng and de) support in `v.0.1.4`.

To change the used instance edit the url (const) in the main.ts to fit your domain (scheme: `https://HOST/jsonrpc.php` e.g. <https://www.schulerzbistum.de/jsonrpc.php>)

### How to setup a development environment

You will need to clone the application with git or download the zip and unpack it.

To get the base dependencies execute `npm install` in the `argon` root folder. You will most likely need a global installation of `tsc` (`npm install -g tsc`) to compile the typescript dependencies. The same may apply (depending on your npm installation) for electron-forge-cli (`npm install -g electron-forge-cli`).

You can execute following scripts (`npm run-script <script>`):

- start: `tsc && electron-forge start` For running the application
- clean: `rm -rf out dist` cleanup of old compiled files and packages
- `clean-start`: `rm -rf out dist && tsc && electron-forge start` combine `clean` and `start`
- `package`: `electron-forge package` package the application
- `make`: `tsc && electron-forge make` make the application executables (deb ...) may invoke package if not done before
- `publish`: `electron-forge publish` not yet implemented
- `lint`: `eslint --ext .ts .` lint the project and see how I screwed up

### How to build a package

At the moment only `.deb` packages are supported and implemented the `package.json`. You should be able to build `.rpm` packages and all supported [makers from electron-forge]()  (including MacOSX, that broken thing from Microsoft and other linux distros).

At least `.rpm` will be supported in the future and MacOSX support is planned for `v.0.1.3`.

_Why is Windows not supported?_

There's no reason to not support it besides the missing resources. To actually package/ compile a package for Windows it is _required_ to run the packaging on windows. I won't do that. If you are running a windows system and are willing to package and test it, do it! But don't expect me to support it in the near future (maybe `v.0.1.8`). MacOSX has the same problem *but* I may be able to get usable access to it *and* it's linux based.

## Roadmap

### v.0.1.4

- English interface support
- Light and Dark theme
- enhanced accessibility support

### v0.1.3

- support for `.rpm` and `MacOSX`
- stable packages (fully tested)

- background process for messages and e-mails (notifications?)
- improved UX/ UI
- full functionality for pupils
- improved processing

### v0.1.1 [Ongoing]

- login
- main menu
- get e-mails and send them
- icon (fas fa-dragon)
